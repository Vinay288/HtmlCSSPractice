                <h2>Snowy Abode: Tours and Trekking in the Mighty Himalayas</h2>
                If there ever was a way to experience living like a maharajah, it is in Rajasthan’s palace hotels.
                Wake up to a peacock dancing on lawns outside your room. Dine on elaborate meals cooked from royal
                recipes, in royal kitchens. Turbaned staff will anticipate your every need, fulfill each tiny wish.
                That’s exactly the way consultants at Enchanting Travels work, tending to every request as they design
                your private North India tour. Not only are they unrelentingly focused on understanding your
                requirements, they are committed to ensuring a glitch-free journey. A hot-air balloon ride? No problem.
                Exploring a secret tunnel between majestic hill forts, or perhaps a twilight boat ride on the Ganges? No
                problem. Come for the Taj, but stay for the diversity and color of North India.
                <br>
                The mighty Himalayas, famous for its hill stations, trekking, and spiritual passages, is the world’s
                highest mountain range, which fringes the north of India in a sweeping 1,500-mile-long arc. At hill
                stations like Manali and Shimla, wake up to panoramas of towering snow-capped peaks and craggy cliffs.
                <br>
                Besides scenic vistas, the Himalayas are spiritually and culturally enriching. Devotional songs rent the
                air as worshipers, at Hindu pilgrimage sites on the banks of the holy river Ganges, sing and pray each
                evening.
                <br>
                Tibetan Buddhism too has deep roots in the Himalayas. Buddhist chants and ritual horns announce the
                start of prayers in McLeod Ganj, home of the Dalai Lama. In the high-altitude desert of Ladakh, daily
                life and spiritual activity at monasteries carry on, unchanged for centuries. With mountains this high,
                there’s plenty of opportunity for soft adventure: hiking trails, trekking routes, white-water rafting.
                <br>
                The Himalayas are breathtaking and soul-stirring, but also vast and complex. Let an Enchanting Travels
                consultant become your mountain guide, building you the perfect itinerary through this awe-inspiring
                landscape.
